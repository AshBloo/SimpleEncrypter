# Requirements

This is a python project that allows the user to encrypt .txt files and save them. It features a graphical user interface and two encryption methods. This application was made with Python 3.9.0 so for best results ensure you are using this version of python or later. You can do this by opening the command prompt (on windows) and typing "python -V" without quotations. This will then print out your version of python. If this brings up an error, you may need to check that you have python installed (as this will not function without it).

# Setup

To run this application on your own machine, you can fork and clone this repository, then run main.py. This will launch the graphical user interface for you to either type a message into or you can open an existing .txt file. The Ceasar cypher requires an encryption key in the form of a whole number (an integer). The Vigenere cypher requires a keyword in the form of a sequence of letters (a string).
