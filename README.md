# SimpleEncrypter
Goal: Rebuilding my old d&amp;d cypher from the ground up. 
Description: A simple application that takes a string and either encodes or decodes it.

Changelog
23/11/2020 - Updated README and added a changelog. Created diary.md to record project progression and thoughts.

1/12/2020 - Created frequencyAnalysis.py and cypherFunctions.py. Split functions off into each and made main.py contain only what is necessary to run the script, pulling extra functions from the two new files.

2/12/2020 - Program now utilises a graphical user interface using the Tkinter module. Users now have the option of loading .txt files and encrypting/decrypting them, and saving the result. At the moment, only Ceasar has been fully implemented.
